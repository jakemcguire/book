Many Silicon Valley tech companies follow the same playbook for interviews. A developer enters the recruiting pipeline by submitting a resume online or through a referral by a current employee. Someone from Human Resources filters resumes by a set of objective criteria, such as requiring candidates to have a Computer Science degree or previous work experience at a tech company.

Candidates who pass this initial gate are scheduled for a phone screener with a member of the engineering team. This 30-60 minute call will often involve a candidate introduction with background questions, then move into a coding challenge to verify the candidate has basic knowledge of programming. Some example questions:

- "What is the meaning of `this` in JavaScript?"
- "What are the four ways you can add CSS to an HTML file?"
- "What is the difference between the `===` and `==` operators in JavaScript?"

These questions can create both **false negatives** and **false positives**. Some candidates may be excellent at programming but struggle to communicate their knowledge clearly; these questions may eliminate candidates who are otherwise qualified but are non-native speakers or struggle with anxiety. Similarly, some candidates may lack programming expertise but pass these questions because they have memorized answers; questions like "contrast React with Angular" may advance candidates who simply read tech news regularly.

Candidates who pass the phone screener are invited to a final on-site interview. It is usually a four-hour, half-day process with four main interviews: the recruiter or HR interviews the candidate in person, the engineering manager does an initial
